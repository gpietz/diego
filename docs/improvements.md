## Further Improvements and Learning Opportunities

#### 1. More on Transformations and Cameras:

- Implement different camera types (e.g., First-Person, Third-Person).
- Experiment with different projection types (Orthogonal, Perspective).

#### 2. Lighting and Materials:

- Add different types of light (Ambient, Diffuse, Specular).
- Implement materials with different properties (Shininess, Reflection).

#### 3. Texturing:

- Learn how to load and apply textures.
- Implement various mapping techniques (UV Mapping, Normal Mapping).

#### 4. Framebuffer and Post-Processing:

- Create and use framebuffers for off-screen rendering.
- Implement post-processing effects like Bloom, HDR, Motion Blur.

#### 5. Animations:

- Add support for skeletal animations.
- Implement keyframe animations and interpolation.

#### 6. Interactive Elements:

- Implement a user interface (UI) with SDL2.
- Add interactions such as drag-and-drop, object selection.
