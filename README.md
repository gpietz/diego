In a world overflowing with OpenGL libraries, I thought, "Hey, why not add one more?" Enter RustyGL, my ambitious (read: slightly misguided) attempt at writing a Rust-based OpenGL library. 
Is it groundbreaking? Probably not. But is it a fun way to sharpen my Rust skills while tangling with ancient C-based APIs? Absolutely.

Why?
Because writing "hello world" got boring, and tackling OpenGL in Rust seemed like a logical next step. Who doesn’t love combining modern, memory-safe Rust with the decades-old mystique 
of OpenGL? It’s like teaching a dinosaur to do backflips... in a sandbox... with guardrails.

Key Features (or eventual goals):

   * A window that opens. Closing it? Well, that’s phase two.
   * Rendering. More than just a triangle is aspirational.
   * Elegant abstractions—by "elegant," I mean "possibly over-engineered, probably unnecessary."
   * Error handling that will make you rethink your life choices.

Disclaimer:
This project is highly experimental. Expect undefined behavior, lots of unwrap()s, and the occasional deep philosophical questioning of why you thought this was a good idea. In short, don't take it too seriously, unless you enjoy debugging more than actual coding.
